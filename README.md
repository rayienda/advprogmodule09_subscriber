  The total number of queued messages on my machine increased to 17 when I ran the publisher, which sent multiple messages to the queue at once. Since the consumer didnâ€™t process them immediately, the messages built up in the queue. After a few seconds, the consumer processed all 17 messages, and the queue total dropped back to zero.
